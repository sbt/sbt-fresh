# sbt-fresh #

sbt-fresh is a plugin for sbt to scaffold an opinionated fresh sbt project: it
creates an sbt build according to established best practices, creates a useful
package object for the root package, initializes a Git repository, creates an
initial commit, etc.

Notice: The build definition created by sbt-fresh is incompatible with the
-Yno-adapted-args scalac option.

Requirements: sbt 1.0 or higher

Add sbt-fresh to your global plugins definition, which most probably resides
under `~/.sbt/1.0/plugins/plugins.sbt`:

``` scala
addSbtPlugin("de.heikoseeberger" % "sbt-fresh" % "<latest-version>")
```

You can define the following settings in your global build definition, which
most probably sits at `~/.sbt/1.0/build.sbt`:

``` scala
import de.heikoseeberger.sbtfresh.license.License // Only needed for `freshLicense` setting

freshOrganization     := "doe.john"        // Organization – "default" by default
freshAuthor           := "John Doe"        // Author – value of "user.name" system property or "default" by default
freshLicense          := Some(License.mit) // Optional license – `apache20` by default
freshSetUpGit         := false             // Initialize a Git repo and create an initial commit – `true` by default
freshSetUpTravis      := true              // Configure Travis for Continuous Integration - `false` by default
freshSetUpWartremover := true              // Include the sbt wartremover (http://www.wartremover.org) plugin - `false` by default
```

Other settings which probably shouldn't be set globally:

``` scala
freshName := ??? // Name – name of build directory by default; doesn't make much sense as a permanent setting

```

In order to scaffold a fresh sbt project, just start sbt in an empty directory.
Then call the `fresh` command, optionally passing one or more of the following
arguments (hit tab for auto completion) which override the respective settings:

- `organization`
- `name`
- `author`
- `license`
- `setUpGit`
- `setUpTravis`
- `setUpWartremover`

Example:

```
sbt> fresh license=bsd3 setUpGit=false setUpTravis=false
```

The following values are available for the license argument:
- `apache20`
- `agpl3`
- `bsd2`
- `bsd3`
- `gpl3`
- `lgpl3`
- `mit`

## Layout

sbt-fresh creates a project with the following layout:

```
+ .gitignore
+ .scalafmt.conf
+ build.sbt                      // build settings
+ LICENSE                        // license file (Apache by default)
+ NOTICE
+ project
--+ build.properties             // sbt version
--+ plugins.sbt                  // sbt-git, sbt-header, sbt-scalafmt
+ README.md
+ src
--+ main
----+ scala
------+ package.scala            // type aliases repointing `Seq` and friends to immutable
```
